## Inside of the repo, please create at least 2 pages that are styled using BOOTSTRAP. Each of the pages at a minimum should contain: 
```sh 
- static text (e.g., headers or paragraphs) 
- a button (does not need to be functional)
- and one other 'component' from boostrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/)
```
